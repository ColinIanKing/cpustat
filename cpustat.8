.SH NAME
cpustat \- a tool to measure CPU utilization.
.br

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cpustat
[ options ]
.RI [ delay " [" count ]]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
cpustat is a program that dumps the CPU utilization of current
running tasks.  Statisics are based on snapshots of processes in the system
and may not be entirely accurate if many short lived processes exist in
a time shorter than the sample time.  cpustat is useful to gain understanding
of long lived process activity in a system, such as daemons, kernel threads, and general user processes.
.P
For each running task that has consumed some CPU during the sample time, the
following information is displayed:
.TS

lBw(10) lBw(50)

Heading	T{
Description
T}
%CPU	T{
Total CPU used (in percent)
T}
%USR	T{
CPU used in user space (in percent)
T}
%SYS	T{
CPU used in system (kernel) space (in percent)
T}
PID	T{
Process ID

S	T{
Process State, R (Running), S (Sleeping), D (Waiting, Disk Sleep), T (Stopped), t (Tracing stopped), W (Paging), X (Dead), x (Dead), K (Wakekill), W (Waking), P (Parked).
T}
CPU	T{
CPU used by the process at time of sampling.
T}
Time	T{
Total CPU time used by the process since it started.

Task	T{
Process command line information (from process cmdline or comm fields)

.TE
.P
cpustat was designed to try and minimize the CPU overhead of performing the
actual process statistics gathering. It is ideal for small embedded devices where
CPU is limited and measuring CPU utilisation can actually affect the overall
CPU statistics. For this reason, it is not as complex as tools such as top
that have a more feature rich user interface and wider functionality.
.SH OPTIONS
cpustat options are as follow:
.TP
.B \-a
calculate CPU utilisation based on all CPUs. For example, if a process
is using 100% of 1 CPU and the system has 4 CPUs, then the utilisation
will show as 25%.  The default is to show utilisation on a per CPU
basis.
.TP
.B \-c
get command information from process comm field.
.TP
.B \-d
strip directory basename off command information.
.TP
.B \-D
compute and show the distribution of CPU utilisation by task and by CPU.
.br
By task, this breaks the CPU utilisation of each task into 20 ranges from minimum to the maximum and shows the count of tasks found at in that paricular utilisation range.  Useful to see any outliers and to characterize the typical per task usage of the CPU.
.br
By CPU, this shows the user and system CPU utilisation by per CPU.
.TP
.B \-g
show grand total of CPU utilisation statistics at the end of the run. This is the
total cumulatave CPU used by each process, averaged over the entire run duration.
.TP
.B \-h
show help.
.TP
.B \-i
ignore cpustat in the statistics.
.TP
.B \-l
show long (full) command information.
.TP
.B \-n task_count
only display the first task_count number of top tasks.
.TP
.B \-p PID
onlt display process that matches the given PID.
.TP
.B \-q 
run quietly, only really makes sense with -r option.
.TP
.B \-r csv_file
output gathered data in a comma separated values file. This
can be then imported and graphed using your favourite open
source spread sheet. The %CPU utilisation (system and user) for
each process at each sample time is output into a table.
.TP
.B \-s
show short command information.
.TP
.B \-S
show time stamp. If the \-r option is used then an extra column
appears in the CSV output file with the time of day for each sample.
.TP
.B \-t threshold
ignore samples where the CPU usage delta per second less than the given threshold.
.TP
.B \-T
calculate total CPU utilisation.
.TP
.B \-x
show extra CPU related statistics, namely: CPU load average over 1, 5 and 10 minutes, CPU frequency (average of all online CPU frequencies), number of CPUs online.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Dump CPU stats every second until stopped.
.RS 8
sudo cpustat
.RE
.LP
Dump the top 20 CPU consuming tasks every 60 seconds until stopped.
.RS 8
sudo cpustat \-n 20 60
.RE
.LP
Dump CPU stats every 10 seconds just 5 times.
.RS 8
sudo cpustat 10 5
